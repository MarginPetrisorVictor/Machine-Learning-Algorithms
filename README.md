# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

This project is made for documenting the process of learning **Machine-Learning** algorithms. For now the only available tehniques are: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression
To be noted that for this algorithms, I follow the **Machine-Learning Specialization** offered by Andrew NG on Coursera.
